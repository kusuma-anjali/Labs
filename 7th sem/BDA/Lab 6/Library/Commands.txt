1.Create a keyspace by name Library

CREATE KEYSPACE Library WITH REPLICATION={'class':'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':1};

 2. Create a column family by name Library-Info with attributes 
 Stud_Id Primary Key, Counter_value of type Counter,Stud_Name, Book-Name, Book-Id, Date_of_issue
CREATE TABLE Library_Info(Stud_Id int,Stud_name text,Book_name text, Book_Id text,Date_of_issue timestamp,Counter_value Counter,PRIMARY KEY(Stud_id,Stud_name,Book_name,Book_Id,Date_of_issue));

3)Insert the values into the table in batch:
UPDATE library_info SET counter_value = counter_value+1 WHERE stud_id=112 and stud_name='Aish' and book_name='BDA' and book_id='1' and date_of_issue='2018-07-23';
UPDATE library_info SET counter_value = counter_value+1 WHERE stud_id=113 and stud_name='KN' and book_name='BDA' and book_id='1' and date_of_issue='2018-07-23'; 
cqlsh:library> select * from library_info;

4)Display the details of the table created and increase the value of the counter
select * from library_info;

5)Write a query to show that a student with id 113 has taken a book “BDA” 2 times.
select * from library_info where stud_id=113;

6)Export the created column to a csv file
COPY library_Info Stud_Id,Stud_name,Book_name,Book_Id,Date_of_issue,Counter_value) to 'F:\Library_Info.csv'

7)Import a given csv dataset from local file system into Cassandra column family
COPY Library_Info(Stud_Id,Stud_name,Book_name,Book_Id,Date_of_issue,Counter_value) FROM 'F:\Library_Info.csv'
